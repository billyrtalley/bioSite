           <p class= "hobbies-p">Adam grew up with an appreciation for the outdoors and the adventure nature brings. Getting together with family and friends to camping is one of his favorite activities. Adam especially loves camping under the stars in a hammock.Another activity Adam is looking to find more time for since moving to St. Louis is kayaking. He misses kayaking and is looking forward to getting on the rivers of Missouri.</p>
           <p class= "hobbies-p">Adam enjoys driving and working on cars and motorcycles.  Adam enjoys getting on the road on an interesting mix of cars and bikes. He’s owned a Jeep for off-roading and a 500hp Pontiac GTO. Adam's motocycles include a Harley Davidson, Yamaha FZ-09, and a 1975 Honda CB200T. Adam is in the process of giving his 2019 Toyota RAV-4 a high-tech upgrade. He recently installed software to improve the adaptive cruise control giving his car autonomous driving capabilities.</p>
           <p class= "hobbies-p">While Adam claims to be a fan of all types of music, it’s the drums that are his favorite instrument. In the last year, he has taken up playing the drums and enjoys the challenge. While it may seem contradictory to some, Adam finds peace and solitude in jamming on his drum set. True to his love of tech, Adam has resurrected an older Roland electronic drum set in favor of a classic set of drums. Another added benefit of his drums, Adam’s son and daughter are wild about dad’s new hobby.</p>
